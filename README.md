# Description
This is next generation of Xia, which is a huge update so I make it a new repository. This version of Xia is an example of a humanlike AI based on open AI, whose role now is the girlfriend of Xeloan(Just an example, please don't mind it). Xia can have fluent a humanlike chat with you and also have a long-term memory of key information. What's more, she can draw a picture for you based on your descrition(No using command, just ask her to draw a picture for you)

This is an old version of Xia, you can view it in my previous repository, just a common discord bot.
